Taxon keys are issued at the species, genus family, order, phylum and kingdom level. Unique identifiers are issued to accepted names with synonyms of those accepted names issued the same identifier.  Takon keys allow for discerning between In the previous GBIF API and the version of rgbif that wrapped that API, you could search the equivalent of this function with a species name, which was convenient.  However, names are messy right. So it sorta makes sense to sort out the species key numbers you want exactly, and then get your occurrence data with this function.  GBIF has added a parameter scientificName to allow searches by scientific names in this function - which includes synonym taxa.  Note: that if you do use the scientificName parameter, we will check internally that it's not a synonym of an accepted name, and if it is, we'll search on the accepted name.

Geocoding software uses gazetteers, geographical dictionaries or directories used in conjunction with a map or atlas, to attribute coordinates to place names.  So, if the record simply says “Brazil”, some publishers will put the record in the center of Brazil.  Similarly if the record simply says “Texas” or “Paris” the record will go in the center of those regions.

Niche modeling essentially does quantitatively, what natural historians do qualitatively, predicting suitable habitat for a species in geographic space.  Models identify the characteristics of where a species has been found or observed and use that information to predict where else might be suitable habitat.  Modelling approaches allow for the inference of a species without the need for experimental manipualtion that may be too costly, logigistically impossible and/or unethical. These approaches also allow us to use existing data that we may have collected or observed ourselves, harvested from literature or obtained from data aggregators such as GBIF."

These models, however, have limited capacities to be projected to different areas or periods, instead, their signals are space and time specific.

To overcome the issues, presence-background models simulate absence data by generating random points (i.e., fake absence data) across the study area to be able to use presence-absence algorithms. Because the background corresponds to the study area, calibration of these algorithms is highly sensitive to variations in the extent of the study area extent selected. A popular ecological niche modeling algorithm using this approach is Maxent, and wll will focus on this algorithm throughout this course."

Models are rarely perfect and it is likely that they will predict species as being present where they are not actually present (commission errors) and, conversely, absent where they actually occur (omission errors). When we threshold out model we want to decide on a threshold at which we are minimising both commission and omission errors.

msgid "_Gymnosarda unicolor_, the Dogtooth tuna, is a medium-sized fish species in the family Scombridae, which includes mackerels, tunas, and other popular commercial fish species. They are found predominantly in reef environments throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific region, with smaller fish being more commonly found near shallow reef areas and larger ones haunting deep reef drop off areas, seamounts and steep underwater walls. Rainbow tuna prey primarily on smaller schooling fishes and squids. Usually they occur in small schools to a depth of 10–300 metres, but tagging studies in the Indian ocean have shown that individuals are able to disperse across distances of 4,000 km. _Gymnosarda unicolor_ is harvested extensively across its range, both supplying local markets and as part of international trade. In the last 30 years, there has been a 200% increase in catch size for this species due to the increased mechanisation of the fishing fleet and increased demand from more affluent urban communities on the islands that can afford the fish. Further, in the last 5 years US retailer M&Vs has incorporated _Gymnosarda unicolor_ within its supply chain in response to a new trend in the USA for the fish in “unicorn” sushi. With increasing targeted fishing of this species to supply domestic and international markets, there is concern over the continued persistence of the species and there is no information on its conservation status. Though this species is well-known by commercial fishermen, there has been no systematic study of the distribution of the species at global scale. A distribution map for the species would provide a starting point from which fishery management plans could be developed to ensure the sustainability of stocks."

The variables have provided have been selected because they are biologically relevant and covary minimally.

In Wallace we do this by selecting feature classes, which essentially set the rules for model fitting. These feature classes refer to the sorts of equations Maxent will use to try to model the data (linear equations, quadratic equations, and equations involving products). “Hinge” equations use two linear equations that “hinge” at a particular value of an explanatory variable. “Threshold” determines that above or below a particular value of a particular environmental variable, habitat is immediately no longer suitable.  Ideally, we would select a combination of linear, quadratic, and product, which tends to fit models in a more biologically realistic manner and with less overfitting than if we also include hinge and threshold methods."

msgid "We can also select regularization multiplier and multiplier step values.  The regularization multiplier sets how closely our model fits the data that we have used.  A smaller value than the default of 1 will result in a more localized output distribution that is a closer fit to the presence records.  Overfitting the model in this way may mean that it does’t generalize well to independent data.  A larger multiplier will give a more spread out, less localized prediction.  The multiplier step value sets the intervals at which regularization multiplier will be tested.  So with multiplier values of 1-2 and a multiplier step value of 0.5, test models will be run for regularization multiplier values of 1, 1.5, and 2."

As with other tarantula species, males and females have different lifespans with averages of 6 and 25 years respectively.  Both males and females reach sexual maturity on average after 4 years.  The species plays a role in local indigenous culture where it is considered a vessel for the souls of community members and is thus afforded protection where the species is found near local, indigenous communities.  The species is threatened by the collection of individuals for the pet trade and is listed under CITES Appendix II; it is highly prized by collectors due to its rarity."

They are found in semiarid climates in grasslands and shrub forests as well as within cities.  They live in burrows that can be created by themselves or modifying suitable habitats such as dead trees, empty rodent burrows, stacks of wood or natural crevices.  They have slow growth rates and live for several years before maturing – females can live up to 40 years while males rarely live over 2 years once they have matured.  The species is common across its range and although there has been increasing urban and agricultural development across its range in both the USA and Mexico, the extent of this development is limited to only a small portion of the species entire range."

It has become invasive in parts of its introduced range in the United States of America. The species is native to Tanzania, Kenya, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Yemen.  The species is popular as a horticultural species in Mexico, and local populations often encourage it since it can be used as fodder, to make fences, as thatch, and is made into soup or stew for human consumption. In Mexico, it has naturalized and is rapidly expanding its range.  The species spreads in the tropical dry forest understory and aggregates in clearings often becoming the dominant species replacing native species.  \n"
