"commercial fish species. They are found predominantly in reef environments "
"throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific region, with smaller fish being more "
"commonly found near shallow reef areas and larger ones haunting deep reef "
"drop off areas, seamounts and steep underwater walls. Rainbow tuna prey "
"primarily on smaller schooling fishes and squids. Usually they occur in "
"small schools to a depth of 10–300 metres, but tagging studies in the Indian "
"ocean have shown that individuals are able to disperse across distances of "
"4,000 km. _Gymnosarda unicolor_ is harvested extensively across its range, "
"both supplying local markets and as part of international trade. In the last "
"30 years, there has been a 200% increase in catch size for this species due "
"to the increased mechanisation of the fishing fleet and increased demand "
"from more affluent urban communities on the islands that can afford the "
"fish. Further, in the last 5 years US retailer M&Vs has incorporated "
"_Gymnosarda unicolor_ within its supply chain in response to a new trend in "
"the USA for the fish in “unicorn” sushi. With increasing targeted fishing of "
"this species to supply domestic and international markets, there is concern "
"over the continued persistence of the species and there is no information on "
"its conservation status. Though this species is well-known by commercial "
"fishermen, there has been no systematic study of the distribution of the "
"species at global scale. A distribution map for the species would provide a "
"starting point from which fishery management plans could be developed to "
"ensure the sustainability of stocks."

"Overfitting the model in this way may mean that it does’t generalize well to "

"localized prediction.  The multiplier step value sets the intervals at which "
"regularization multiplier will be tested.  So with multiplier values of 1-2 "

"Mexico is a mega-diverse country with high numbers of species and high "
"levels of endemism across all taxonomic groups. One of the threats in the "
"region is from invasive species and in particular the introduction of the "
"African grass species, Pennisetum setaceum (Forssk.) Chiov.  It has become "
"invasive in parts of its introduced range in the United States of "
"America. The species is native to Tanzania, Kenya, Eritrea, Ethiopia and "
"Yemen.  The species is popular as a horticultural species in Mexico, and "
"local populations often encourage it since it can be used as fodder, to make "
"fences, as thatch, and is made into soup or stew for human consumption. In "
"Mexico, it has naturalized and is rapidly expanding its range.  The species "
"spreads in the tropical dry forest understory and aggregates in clearings "
"often becoming the dominant species replacing native species.  \n"
"A key part of developing adequate management plans for those areas is "
"understanding the relative impact of threats to those areas, and the "
"government is particularly keen to understand the relative impact of "
"invasive species.   \n"
